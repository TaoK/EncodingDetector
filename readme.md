This project constitutes a "wrapper" around the existing "TextFileEncodingDetector.cs" gist, providing test cases etc.

I like the simplicity of a single class for a simple task, but I would also like to be able to provide a more complete/rigorous package where requested.

Next Steps:

* Add VS2008 Solution
* Add test cases
* Update any online references (eg on stackoverflow)
